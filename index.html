            <h3>What is Vangr?</h3>
            <p>Vangr is an early-stage project with four core goals:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Deliver powerful task-focused software collections, prioritizing the best tools for the job.</li>
                <li>Reduce busywork with pre-tuned configs and templates.</li>
                <li>Build a community rooted in learning and support.</li>
                <li>Of course, make it all look good too.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Why Vangr?</h3>
            <p>While Linux has grown easier to use over the years, it still has rough edges. For power users and developers? These edges are easily smoothed. For everyday fólk? Even something simple like gaming has its pain points. I want to change that. Vangr won't be able to smooth every edge, but it can attempt to work down the most obvious ones.</p>
            <h3>Focused on Power</h3>
            <p>Other projects already offer a minimalist approach. They're beautiful starting points for a curated garden. Vangr is not that, it's a wild field meant to be sowed and reaped. What does that look like?</p>
            <p>Music production can benefit from being greedy. Plugins are the lifeblood of many producers, so the full LADSPA, LV2, and VST plugin meta packages will be included. This is a total of 106 packages, not including dependencies.</p>
            <p>For video editing: Kdenlive's optional dependencies are often must-haves for the full toolkit. A proper editor (not just for video) also demands a robust effects library, so Vangr includes any available.</p>
            <p>This philosophy means a full Vangr installation will be large, it doesn't mean we're going to go off the deep-end. Effort will be put in to make sure packages aren't included just to satisfy a niche use case.</p>
            <h3>Communal Improvement</h3>
            <p>We all have our hot takes and the receipts to back them up. If you think Vangr is missing the mark, I want to hear from you! Join me at the Discord server, <a href="https://vangr.net/discord">Fólkvangr</a>.</p>
            <h3>Planned Features</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Task-focused collections provided via a modular installer (e.g., music production, video editing, game dev, office, broadcasting).</li>
                <li>Beautiful rice (custom desktop/themes), including a <a href="https://quickshell.org/">Quickshell</a>-powered Wayland shell.</li>
                <li>Stacking-first or tiling-first window management, powered by <a href="https://hypr.land/">Hyprland</a>.</li>
                <li>Support for both vim and emacs style keyboard bindings</li>
                <li>Support for keyboard, mouse or hybrid style window management & software operations</li>
                <li>Hardware auto-detection: Probe your rig and install optimal drivers out of the box.</li>
                <li>Auto-setup for CachyOS and Chaotic-AUR repos on any Arch base.</li>
                <li>AI integration for various tools (ex. Krita with ComfyUI)</li>
                <li>Enhanced Firefox security & performance without reliance on a fork</li>
                <li>Emphasis on daemonizable software for fast startup speeds, and in cases like terminals, VRAM footprint reduction for multple windows.</li>
                <li>Performance/gaming mode that disables compositing effects like blur/animations/transparency to lower VRAM footprint</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Getting Started</h3>
            <p>Vangr's still in planning. Keen to contribute, join the kin, or track the forge? Hop into the Discord hall, <a href="https://vangr.net/discord">Fólkvangr</a>.</p>
